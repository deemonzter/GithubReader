# GithubReader
GithubReader communicates with Github API v3

I have made this application to show how to communicate with Github's REST API.

Several technologies, techniques, and patterns were used in this exercise:
* It uses delegates and blocks for callbacks.
* It uses basic authentication for all HTTP requests.
* It uses NSURLSessionDataTask for HTTP GET requests.
* It uses CoreData for persistence.
* It uses Cocoapods for dependency management.

This app has been tested on the following devices:
* iPhone6 with v8.1.2
* iPhone5 with v7.1.2
* iPadMini2 with v8.1
